###### Favourite quotes
> "I see things at night... terrifying things. I tell myself it's only nightmares, but... I know it's not true. Once Pandora's box is open, it can never be closed again. No... it's not nightmares. It's what is about to happen. I've died twice already. I'm not afraid of death anymore."
