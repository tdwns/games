> "The Rapture dream is over, but in waking, I am reborn. This world is not ready for me, yet here I am. It would be so easy to misjudge them. You are my conscious father, and I need you to guide me. You'll always be with me now father, your memories, your drives, and when I need you, you'll be there on my shoulder, whispering. If utopia is not a place, but a people, then we must choose carefully, and in our story, Rapture was just the beginning."
